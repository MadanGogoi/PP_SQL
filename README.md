# PP_SQL
Here, I am using Social Media Influencers - Youtube dataset and implementing exploratory SQL analysis.


  The dataset (Social Media Influencers - Youtube), which is available in Kaggle dataset (the link is given below). Here, in this project I am doing exploratory SQL analysis.
  The dataset contains info about the youtube channels and their other aspects like subscribers, average views/ likes /comments they got . The info basically of September month .

  The aim of this project is to find relations bt. different attributes of the data. Here, I find some relations like :
  Which Youtuber has the most subscribers, average views etc.
  Which channel gets more comments.
  In which categories, there are most subscribers,average likes, which category has how many channels.
